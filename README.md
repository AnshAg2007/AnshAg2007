I started coding as a new hobby, being locked in my home back in 2020/21 taught me what I still consider as one of my greatest skills, during those 2 years I did several passion projects, collaborated with people, tried learning a lot of languages like a novice programmer would, but only python stuck, I enjoyed doing all sorts of things in Python, it helped me make new friends aswell from the Python discord community, speaking of Discord, discord bots is the reason I got into coding, I liked what bots like MEE6 or Dyno back then could do but a lot was locked behind a paywall, that was when I got to know that I could make a bot by myself however I wanted it to be, and I did. From there, the array of different things I'd do in the language only increased and today, after 4 years, I am doing a lot more in the field, In 2020, I was just a young adolescent who wanted to do all sorts of things, but now I've grown and have a lot of responsibilities to take and a goal I've given priority to. I'm only focusing on one thing at a time. I've done some modifications to my profile after not even checking it for almost 2 years. I've taken an indefinitely long break; I am unable to spare time for my 'passion' right now and won't be able to anytime soon, I am still deeply connected with what goes on in the tech world in general, I'v privated some repositories which were once public due to various reasons and my website is also down as the domain name expired back in June 2022, I intend to get back to all of this once I am done with my final years of schooling, for now I only do some fun projects here and there in private every once in a while.

My email has been updated, for any sort of thing, please mail me on rocksaltprism@proton.me only.

Adios. <3
